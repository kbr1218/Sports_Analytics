## Data Science

Data Science: Turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge

Process:

1.  Import: Bring data into your program. R -\> data frame

2.  Tidy: Make sure data is in the correct form and workable. Consistency is key (wrangling)

3.  Transform: Create new variables, filter out data, summarize data

4.  Visualize: Look at relationships, form research questions: Needs to be analyzed

5.  Model: Simplified versions of reality focus on key relationships. Make predictions

6.  Communicate: Analysis is only as good as your communication. Explain intuition, tell story, precise

|Hypothesis Generation|Hypothesis Confirmation|
|---|---|
|Explore the data|Use precise mathematical model and statistics|
|Generate interesting hypotheses| |
|Evaluate informally| |

<br>

## Types of Analysis

1.  Descriptive: Summarize data (what happened)

2.  Diagnostic: Find cause of outcome (why did this happen)

3.  Predictive: Predict future outcome (what will happen next)

4.  Prescriptive: Advise course of action

<br>

## Getting Started with R

1.  Install R (<https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>)

2.  Install RStudio Desktop (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>)

3.  Create a class folder on your computer or Google Drive

4.  Create an R Project

5.  Install Tidyverse -\> install.packages("\_\_\_\_")

<br>

## Exercises

1.  What are packages? A collection of commands, functions, datasets, etc. used in R that are coded to make it easier to do what you want.

2.  Install the Lahman package.

3.  Create three sports related hypotheses (hypothesis generation).

    1.  Is the home team's winning rate different from before COVID-19 in the game without spectators after COVID-19?

    2.  The relationship between the number of passes and the goal in a soccer game?

    3.  Which of the pitchers and batters can be categorically said to have a high relationship with team victory in baseball games?
